Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported in python.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.03) Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\\n\\nAns.) Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.04) What is the correct extension of the python file?\\n\\nAns.) .py\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.05) Is python code compiled or interpreted?\\n\\nAns.) Python is an interpreted language.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.06) Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?\\n\\nAns.) Python code block.\\n        A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.07) State a character used to give single-line comments in python?\\n\\nAns.) single character -->  #\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.08) Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\\n\\nAns.) The function (sys. version) can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.09) python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called....\\n\\nAns.)  \"lambda\" \\n\\n\\n\\nQues.10) What does pip stands for python?\\n\\nAns.) preferred installer program.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.11) Mention a few built-in functions in python?\\n\\nAns.) print( ) function,\\n      type( ) function,\\n      input( ) function,\\n      abs( ) function,\\n      pow( ) function,\\n      dir( ) function,\\n      sorted( ) function,\\n      max( ) function.\\n      \\n      etc......\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.12) What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in python?\\n\\nAns.) 79 characters.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.13) what are the benifits of using python? \\n\\nAns.) Python Commands Demand,\\n      Earning Potential,\\n      Ease of Comprehension,\\n      Flexibility,\\n      Used in Many Industries,\\n      Help a Startup-Startup,\\n      Python Security,\\n      \\n      etc.......\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.14) How is memmory managed in python?\\n\\nAns.) Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. \\n      The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. \\n      The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, \\n      like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.15) How to install python on Windows and set path variables?\\n\\nAns.) The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\\n\\n      1.) Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\\n      \\n      2.) Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\\n\\n      3.) Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\\n\\n      4.) In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\\n\\n      5.) Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\\n\\n\\n\\nQues.16) Is indentation required in python?\\n\\nAns.) Yes, the indentation in Python is very important.\\n\\n\\n'"
